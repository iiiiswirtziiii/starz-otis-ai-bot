 STARZ Z.O.R.P / O.R.P GUIDE
===========================

What is ORP?
- Offline Raid Protection
- Automatically protects a team's base while they are offline.
- The zone forms a circle around the base.

Zone Expiration:
- ORP zones expire every 24 hours.
- Team leaders MUST refresh daily with:
  1. “Can I build around here?”
  2. “Yes.”
- Bot message in-game: “ORP REFRESHED.”

Activation Requirements:
- Must be in a team.
- Must be the *team leader*.
- Use “Can I build around here?” then “Yes.”

Deleting a Zone:
- Team leader uses:
  1. “Can I build around here?”
  2. “Goodbye.”

Zone Overlap Rules:
- ZORP zones cannot overlap any other team’s zone.
- If a zone overlaps, the setup fails.

Zone Color Codes:
- WHITE: New zone setting up (wait for green).
- GREEN: Team online.
- YELLOW: Team offline but not long enough (“ZORP time”).
- RED: Fully offline-protected.
- RED only occurs after enough offline time passes + green zone was fully initialized.

Initialization Delay:
- After activation, there is a ~15-minute delay before it can switch from GREEN → RED.

Raid Alerts Setup:
1. Link your Discord account in #kaos-link with `/link`
2. Use `/raidlink` to get your private RF frequency.
3. Place an RF broadcaster and set it to your frequency.
4. Connect broadcaster → timer (300 sec).
5. Connect timer → seismic sensor (range around 30).
6. You now receive raid ping alerts in Discord.

How to Refresh ORP:
- Team leader must use:
  “Can I build around here?”
  “Yes”
- This prevents expiration for another 24 hours.

Actions That Break ORP (DO NOT DO):
- Do NOT kill any sleeping teammates.
- Do NOT transfer team leader.
- Do NOT invite new teammates.
- Do NOT remove teammates.
- Do NOT log out while the circle is WHITE.
- Always wait until the circle turns GREEN before logging off.

Common Problems:
- Circle stuck white → wait longer, re-run CAB & YES.
- Zone expired → team leader must reactivate.
- Zone not turning RED → team didn't stay offline long enough or violated restrictions.
- “Zone overlaps” → another team has protection too close.
